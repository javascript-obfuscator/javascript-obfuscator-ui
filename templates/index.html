            <h1>JavaScript Obfuscator Tool</h1>
            <p>A free and efficient obfuscator for JavaScript (including ES6). Make your code harder to copy and prevent people from stealing your work. This tool is a Web UI to the excellent (and open source) <a href="https://github.com/sanex3339/javascript-obfuscator/" target="_new">JavaScript Obfuscator</a> created by Timofey Kachalov.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <h3>What is this?</h3>
          <p>This tools transforms your original JavaScript source code into a new representation that's harder to understand, copy, re-use and modify without authorization. The obfuscated result will have the exact functionality of the original code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>So, like UnglifyJS, Closure Compiler, etc?</h3>
          <p>Yes and no. While UglifyJS (and others minifiers) does make the output code harder to understand (compressed and ugly), it can be easily be transformed into something readable using a JS Beautifier.</p>
          <p>This tool prevents that by using various transformations and "traps", such as <strong>self-defending</strong> and <strong>debug protection</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>How does the obfuscation works?</h3>
          <p>Through a series of transformations, such as variable / function / arguments renaming, strings removal, and others, your source code is transformed into something unreadable, while working exatcly as before.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Sounds great!</h3>
          <p>Just paste your code or upload it below and click on "obfuscate".</p>
          <p>Also, be sure to read about all the options to understand all the trade-offs between code protection and code size / speed.</p>

                  </div>

                  <p>Source maps can be useful to help you debug your obfuscated Java Script source code. If you want or need to debug in production, you can upload the separate source map file to a secret location and then point your browser there. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps" target="_new">Read more about source maps on the Google Chrome Developer Tools website</a>.</p>

                  <strong>Inline Source Map</strong>
                  <p>This embeds the source map of your source in the result of the obfuscated code. Useful if you just want to debug locally on your machine.</p>

                  <strong>Separate Source Map</strong>
                  <p>This generates a separate file with the source map. Useful to debug code in production, as this enables you to upload the source map to a secret location on your server and then point your browser to use it.</p>

                  <p>Use the <strong>Source Map Base URL</strong> and <strong>Source Map File Name</strong> to customize the <code>sourceMappingURL</code> property that will get appended to the end of your obfuscated code.</p>

                  <p>For instance, if you set the <strong>Base URL</strong> to <code>"http://localhost:9000"</code> and <strong>File Name</strong> to <code>"example"</code>, you'll get: <code>//# sourceMappingURL=http://localhost:9000/example.js.map</code>. appended to the end of your obfuscated code.</p>

                  <strong>Multiple domains and sub-domains</strong>
                  <p>It's possible to lock your code to more than one domain or sub-domain. For instance, to lock it so the code only runs on <code>www.example.com</code> add <code>www.example.com</code>, to make it work on any sub-domain from example.com, use <code>.example.com</code>.</p>

          <h3>FAQ</h3>

          <h4>Why would I want to obfuscate my JavaScript code?</h4>
          <p>There're a numerous reasons why it's a good idea to protect your code, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prevent anyone from simply copy/pasting your work. This is specially important on 100% client side projects, such as HTML5 games;</li>
            <li>Removal of comments and whitespace that aren't needed. Making it faster to load and harder to understand;</li>
            <li>Protection of work that hasn't been paid yet. You can show your work to the client knowing that they won't have the source code until the invoice has been paid.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Is this obfuscator absolutely foolproof?</h4>
          <p>No, while it's impossible to recover the exact original source code, someone with the time, knowledge and patience can reverse-engineer it.</p>
          <p>Since the JavaScript runs on the browser, the browser JavaScript engine must be able to read and interpret it, so there's no way to prevent that. And any tool that promises you that is lying.</p>

          <h4>Why my obfuscated code is larger than my original source?</h4>
          <p>Because the obfuscator introduces new pieces of code that are meant to protect and defend against debugging and reverse-engineering.</p>

          <h4>Can I run a minifier such as UglifyJS or Google Closure Compiler on the obfuscated output?</h4>
          <p>No, it's not recommended and in some cases it'll break the code (such as if you enable <strong>self-defending</strong>. You can run before to make sure that it removes dead code and do other optimizations, though.</p>

          <h4>Do you store my source code?</h4>
          <p>No. The source is processed by our application server to the obfuscator and back to the browser, so it only stays on our server memory for a brief period of time (usually milliseconds). </p>

          <h4>Can I recover the original source code from the obfuscated one?</h4>
          <p>No, that's impossible, so keep it safe.</p>

          <h4>Does this tool works with Node.js source code?</h4>
          <p>Yes.</p>

          <h4>I want to run the obfuscator on my own server/machine. Is it possible?</h4>
          <p>Sure. This tool uses a free and open source (MIT licensed) obfuscator written in TypeScript. You can go to <a href="https://github.com/sanex3339/javascript-obfuscator/" target="_new">its GitHub page</a> and read more there.</p>
